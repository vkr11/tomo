# Strategy Framework (IC7/D1 Level)

> **Core Definition from Google's "PM House":**
> **"As CEO of [Product/Company], what do you do in [Situation]?"**
>
> | Dimension | Description |
> |-----------|-------------|
> | **Primary Signal** | **Business Leadership**: Can you understand business issues and back them up with business model reasoning? |
> | **Weak Answer** | Feature-focused, user-only perspective, reactive to competitors, ignores unit economics. |

## The 4 Strategic Directions (MECE Framework)

We group the 7 archetypes into 4 mutually exclusive buckets based on the **Direction of Value**: Creating (0→1), Scaling (1→N), Defending (N), or Shifting (Transformation).

### I. The Builder (0 → 1)
*Direction: Creation. Inventing new value hooks.*

#### 1. New Market Entry ("The Expansion")
*   **The Core Question:** "Should [Company] build a specific product (Vertical) or provide the platform for others (Horizontal)?"
*   **Examples:** "Should Airbnb offer furniture retail services?" (Brand permission), "Should Amazon build a specialized healthcare product?" (Capability)
*   **The Strategic Angle:**
    *   **Framework:** TAM (Opportunity) → Moat (Advantage) → Capabilities (Build/Buy/Partner) → Unit Economics.
    *   **Key Concepts:** Integration complexity, Competency trap, Brand permission, Horizontal vs. Vertical expansion.

#### 2. Moonshots ("First Principles")
*   **The Core Question:** "Solve a problem that has no playbook."
*   **Examples:** "How would you map an unmapped area?", "How would you revolutionize the car wash industry?"
*   **The Strategic Angle:**
    *   **Framework:** Deconstruct to Physics → Analogize → Rebuild.
    *   **Key Concepts:** 10x thinking, removing constraints, reasoning from first principles.

### II. The Scaler (1 → N)
*Direction: Expansion. Maximizing the area under the curve.*

#### 3. Growth Engines ("The Flywheel")
*   **The Core Question:** "How do we double the user base or revenue? Design the non-linear growth engine."
*   **Examples:** "How would you double YouTube’s user base?", "Uber wants to enter the 'Services' market. Draw the flywheel."
*   **The Strategic Angle:**
    *   **Framework:** Growth Equation (Acquisition + Retention + Monetization) → Identify Constraint → Systemic Levers.
    *   **Key Concepts:** Network Effects (Direct/Indirect), The Cold Start Problem, Cross-side benefits, Reducing friction vs. Increasing value.

#### 4. Monetization ("The Business Model")
*   **The Core Question:** "Turn this engagement into value capture without destroying the user experience."
*   **Examples:** "How would you monetize Wikipedia?", "How would you monetize Facebook Marketplace?"
*   **The Strategic Angle:**
    *   **Framework:** Value Metric → Pricing Model (Ads vs Sub vs Trans) → System Effects.
    *   **Key Concepts:** LTV/CAC ratio, Margin structures, Marketplace Liquidity, Matching efficiency.

### III. The Guardian (Defending N)
*Direction: Retention. Protecting value from erosion.*

#### 5. Defense & Turnaround ("The Moat")
*   **The Core Question:** "A competitor is eating our lunch, or a product is dying. Fix it or kill it."
*   **Examples:** "TikTok is eating YouTube's watch time. What is the *structural* response?", "Instagram Stories is lowering time-spent in Feed."
*   **The Strategic Angle:**
    *   **Framework:** Root Cause (Structural vs Execution) → Strategic Alignment → Execution Path.
    *   **Key Concepts:** Switching costs, Data moats, Commoditization, Cannibalization (eating your own lunch before someone else does).

### IV. The Transformer (Macro Shifts)
*Direction: Adaptation. Structurally changing the business container.*

#### 6. The Platform Shift ("The Pivot")
*   **The Core Question:** "A massive technological wave (AI, AR, Cloud) threatens our core. What is the survival plan?"
*   **Examples:** "Generative AI threatens Google Search. Walk me through the transition.", "Creator economy evolution."
*   **The Strategic Angle:**
    *   **Framework:** Macro Trend → User Behavior Shift → Strategic Bet (H1/H2/H3).
    *   **Key Concepts:** Innovator's Dilemma, Sustaining vs. Disruptive innovation, "Skating to where the puck is going," Horizon planning.

#### 7. Corporate Strategy ("The CEO View")
*   **The Core Question:** "Manage the portfolio. Do we buy, merge, or divest?"
*   **Examples:** "Pretend Google wants to acquire iRobot.", "Why did WeWork fail?"
*   **The Strategic Angle:**
    *   **Framework:** Strategic Fit (Synergy) → Financial Feasibility → Integration Risk.
    *   **Key Concepts:** Portfolio management, build vs. buy, synergy verification.

## Tactical Frameworks for Specific Questions

### A. The "Turnaround" (Fixing a dying product)
*Use the "Engagement Funnel" approach (Source: FB Events Strategy).*

Don't just say "make it better." Break down engagement into layers:
1.  **Awareness:** Do people even know it exists? (Marketing/Distribution fix)
2.  **Basic Engagement:** Do they try it once? (Onboarding/Activation fix)
3.  **Deep Engagement:** Do they form a habit? (Core Value Prop/Retention fix)

### B. The "Monetization" Question
*Don't just slap ads on it.*

1.  **Ad-Model:** Requires high engagement/time-spent + scale.
2.  **Subscription:** Requires high utility/ongoing value (Google Drive).
3.  **Transactional:** Requires high trust/intent (Airbnb).
4.  **Freemium:** The "Hook" is free, the "Power" is paid.

## Company-Specific Flavors (Know your audience)

| Company | Strategy Style | Typical Question |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Google** | **"The Moonshot"** | *"How would you map an unmapped area?"* <br> *"How do you see the creator economy in 10 years?"* |
| **Meta** | **"The Social Graph"** | *"What should Meta do next?"* (Broad open-ended) <br> *"Should Meta enter the dating market?"* |
| **Amazon** | **"Customer Obsession"** | *"How would you sell live plants on Amazon?"* <br> *"Should we launch 'Prime Lite'?"* |
| **Apple** | **"Focus & Subtraction"** | *"If you were CEO, what product would you kill?"* (Rare: asking to *remove* things) |
| **Netflix** | **"Content & Expansion"** | *"What new product line would double revenue?"* (Gaming, Merchandise, Live Sports) |

## Business Model Reasoning
*The "Math" behind the Strategy.*

You must be able to derive your strategy from first principles of the business model.

*   **Ad-Based:** Attention, RPM, Inventory load, Advertiser ROI.
*   **Subscription (SaaS):** LTV, CAC, Churn, ARR, Expansion revenue (NDR).
*   **Marketplace:** Take-rate, GMV, Liquidity, Matching efficiency.
*   **Hardware/Transactional:** BOM cost, Margin, Replacement cycle.

> **Example:** "We shouldn't launch a subscription for [Product X] because our ad-model relies on maximum reach (DAU), and putting a paywall friction kills the flywheel that feeds our data advantage."

## Practice Questions (IC7/D1 Bar)

*   [ ] "How would you monetize Wikipedia?" (Classic business model creativity)
*   [ ] "Should Airbnb offer furniture retail services?" (Brand stretch vs Core focus)
*   [ ] "Imagine you’re the CEO of Apple—what product would you eliminate from the lineup?"
*   [ ] "How does Google Search survive the shift to LLM-based answers? Walk me through the business model transition."
*   [ ] "You are the CEO of Netflix. Gaming is not taking off. Do you kill it, acquire a studio, or pivot strategy? Why?"
*   [ ] "Design a 3-year strategy to make [Product] defensible against a clone with 10x funding."
*   [ ] "Should [Company] open-source their core proprietary tech? What is the strategic gain?"
*   [ ] "We have $100M. Do we fix our technical debt (Velocity) or acquire [Competitor] (Market Share)?"

## Antipatterns to Avoid

*   ❌ **"Building a feature" as a strategy:** Strategy is a *direction* and a *set of choices*. "Add a chatbot" is a feature. "Pivot to AI-first support to reduce OPEX" is a strategy.
*   ❌ **Ignoring the "Money":** Failing to mention how this impacts revenue, margins, or LTV.
*   ❌ **Generic MBA Frameworks:** Don't just say "Porter's 5 Forces." Use the concepts naturally ("Supplier power is too high here...").
