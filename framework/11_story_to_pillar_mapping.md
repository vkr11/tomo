## The "5 Essential Stories" (From Master Guide)

Mapping the Master Guide's required stories to your epics:

| Required Story Type | Your Epic | Specific Keyframe | Pillars Hit |
|---------------------|-----------|-------------------|-------------|
| **1. Turnaround** | Friend Graph | "Ask for Help" → Stabilized 38-person team | 3, 5, 6 |
| **2. 0 → 1** | Llama Safety | Purple Llama launch | 1, 7, 8 |
| **3. People Crisis** | Friend Graph | Managing stretched team / hiring gap | 5, 6 |
| **4. Technical Bet** | VRS | BISG for demographic inference | 1, 7, 8 |
| **5. Failure** | PETs / IPA | Hiring failures + slow proposal release | 4, 5, 6 |

## How to Use This in Interviews

### Step 1: Identify the Pillar Being Tested
*Interviewer*: "Tell me about a time you launched a 0-to-1 product."

↓ This is testing **Pillar 1 (Strategy)** + **Pillar 3 (Execution)**

### Step 2: Select the Right Epic
Look at table above → **Llama Safety (Purple Llama)** or **PETs/IPA** are your best 0→1 stories.

### Step 3: Deliver Using Story Framework
1. **Context**: "At Meta during the GenAI safety crisis..."
2. **Epic**: "I was leading Purple Llama, our 0-to-1 safety initiative..."
3. **STAR**: [Deliver the specific story]
4. **Principle**: "This reinforced my belief in *Think Big*..."

## Enhancement: Cross-Reference Table

| Interview Pillar | Your Strongest Epics | Gap Areas |
|------------------|---------------------|-----------|
| **1. Strategy** | PETs (W3C), Llama Safety (Open Weights) | ✅ Strong |
| **2. Sense** | `TODO: Consumer product stories?` | ⚠️ Need examples |
| **3. Execution** | WhatsApp MM, VRS, Friend Graph | ✅ Strong |
| **4. Metrics** | `TODO: Need A/B test stories` | ⚠️ Need examples |
| **5. Management** | Friend Graph (38-person team) | ⚠️ Limited depth |
| **6. Leadership** | All epics have conflict/influence stories | ✅ Strong |
| **7. Technical** | VRS (BISG), PETs (MPC), Llama (RLHF) | ✅ Strong |
| **8. Domain (Ads/AI)** | All Meta epics | ✅ Strong |

---

## Gaps to Fill

Based on the cross-reference:
1.  **Pillar 2 (Sense)**: Need a "Design Critique" or "User Empathy" story. Did you ever push back on a design? Change UX based on user feedback?
2.  **Pillar 4 (Metrics)**: Need an A/B test story. Did you ever debug a metric drop? Run a complex experiment?
3.  **Pillar 5 (Management)**: Need deeper "Hiring Bar" or "Team Scaling" stories beyond the 38-person anecdote.
