# Execution Framework

> **Goal**: Demonstrate ability to ship complex products through ambiguity
>
> | Dimension | Description |
> |-----------|-------------|
> | **Signals** | Operational rigor, XFN leadership, risk management, tradeoff judgment |
> | **Weak Answer** | Describes process generically, takes credit without specifics, blames others |
> | **Strong Answer** | Shows ownership of hard tradeoffs, names specific XFN alignment tactics, quantifies outcomes |
> | **IC5/IC6** | "I wrote the PRD, worked with Eng, and we shipped on time" |
> | **IC7/D1** | "We were 3 weeks behind. I de-scoped feature Y (10% of value, 40% of effort), got Legal aligned by framing as revenue risk, and shipped 2 days early. Result: +15% conversion." |

## Core Signals to Show

- [ ] Operational rigor
- [ ] XFN leadership
- [ ] Risk management
- [ ] Tradeoff judgment
- [ ] Quantified outcomes

## Common Question Types

| Question | Key Elements to Address |
|----------|------------------------|
| "How do you ship?" | Process, XFN alignment, milestones, risk mitigation |
| "Who owns what?" | RACI clarity, accountability, escalation paths |
| "How do you align XFN?" | Stakeholder mapping, communication cadence, buy-in tactics |
| "What's the risk?" | Risk identification, mitigation strategies, contingencies |
| "Why was it delayed?" | Root cause, what you learned, what changed |

## My Framework/Approach

### Step 1: Scope & Milestones
*How I define scope and break down work*

```
[ Your approach to scoping and milestone definition ]
```

### Step 2: XFN Alignment
*How I get cross-functional buy-in*

```
[ Stakeholder mapping, communication tactics, etc. ]
```

### Step 3: Risk Management
*How I identify and mitigate risks*

```
[ Risk register approach, mitigation strategies ]
```

### Step 4: Tradeoff Decisions
*How I make hard tradeoffs*

```
[ Framework for scope/time/quality tradeoffs ]
```

### Step 5: Execution Cadence
*How I run the execution machine*

```
[ Meeting cadence, status updates, blockers resolution ]
```

## XFN Alignment Playbook

| Stakeholder | What They Care About | How to Align |
|-------------|---------------------|--------------|
| Engineering | Feasibility, tech debt | Early tech spikes, clear specs |
| Design | User experience | Joint discovery, user research |
| Legal | Risk, compliance | Frame as "revenue protection" |
| Marketing | Positioning, timing | Launch playbook, messaging input |
| Sales | Revenue, customer asks | Success stories, competitive intel |
| Leadership | Strategy, metrics | OKR alignment, executive updates |

## Practice Questions

- [ ] "Tell me about a time you shipped something complex"
- [ ] "How did you handle XFN misalignment?"
- [ ] "What was your biggest execution challenge?"
- [ ] "Tell me about a time you had to de-scope"

---

## Key Phrases & Terminology

| Term | When to Use |
|------|-------------|
| "De-scoped X (Y% value, Z% effort)" | When showing tradeoff judgment |
| "Got alignment by framing as..." | When showing influence skills |
| "Risk mitigation via..." | When showing operational rigor |
| "Result: +X% [metric]" | Always quantify outcomes |

---

## De-Scoping Framework

When to de-scope:
```
1. Value/Effort ratio is unfavorable
2. Dependency on blocked workstream
3. Risk to core launch timeline
4. Can be iterated post-launch
```

How to communicate:
```
1. Frame as prioritization, not failure
2. Show value retained vs effort saved
3. Define iteration plan
4. Get XFN buy-in before announcing
```

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

❌ Describing process generically  
❌ Taking credit without specifics  
❌ Blaming others for delays  
❌ Missing quantified outcomes
