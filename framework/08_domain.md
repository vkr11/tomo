# Domain Expertise Framework

> **Goal**: Demonstrate deep expertise in specific product areas
>
> | Dimension | Description |
> |-----------|-------------|
> | **Signals** | Industry-specific knowledge, regulatory awareness, ecosystem fluency |
> | **Weak Answer** | Generic knowledge, no nuance, can't go 2 levels deep |
> | **Strong Answer** | Explains domain mechanics (e.g., ad auction dynamics), knows edge cases, understands policy/regulatory landscape |
> | **IC5/IC6** | "Ads work by bidding for impressions" |
> | **IC7/D1** | "Second-price auctions optimize for truth-telling but erode margin. We shifted to first-price with bid shading ML to recover 8% revenue while maintaining advertiser trust." |
