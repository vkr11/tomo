# Sense (Product Sense) Framework

> **Goal**: Demonstrate product intuition and user empathy
>
> | Dimension | Description |
> |-----------|-------------|
> | **Signals** | User-centric thinking, creativity, structured problem breakdown, prioritization logic |
> | **Weak Answer** | Jumps to solutions, no user segmentation, no prioritization framework |
> | **Strong Answer** | Segments users, identifies JTBD, explores multiple solutions, prioritizes with clear criteria |
> | **IC5/IC6** | "I'd add feature X because it's a top request in user feedback" |
> | **IC7/D1** | "The core JTBD is Y. Segment A values speed, Segment B values customization. I'd prioritize A because it's 70% of revenue. Here's the MVP and iteration plan." |

## Core Signals to Show

- [ ] User-centric thinking
- [ ] Creativity in solutions
- [ ] Structured problem breakdown
- [ ] Prioritization logic
- [ ] JTBD understanding

---

## Common Question Types

| Question | Key Elements to Address |
|----------|------------------------|
| "Design X for [company]" | User segments, JTBD, solution options, prioritization |
| "Improve Y" | Current pain points, metrics, feature ideas, tradeoffs |
| "Pick top 3 features" | Prioritization framework, effort/impact, dependencies |
| "Kill or keep?" | Data analysis, user value, strategic alignment |
| "Who's the user?" | Segmentation, personas, behavioral insights |

## My Framework/Approach

### Step 1: Clarify & Scope
*Questions I ask to understand the problem*

```
[ Define your clarifying questions here ]
- What's the user segment?
- What's the business goal?
- What are the constraints?
```

### Step 2: User Segmentation
*How I break down users*

```
[ Your segmentation approach ]
- Primary vs secondary users
- Needs-based segments
- Behavioral segments
```

### Step 3: Jobs to Be Done
*How I identify core JTBD*

```
[ JTBD format: When ___, I want to ___, so I can ___ ]
```

### Step 4: Solution Generation
*How I brainstorm solutions*

```
[ Approach: 3+ solutions, divergent thinking, etc. ]
```

### Step 5: Prioritization
*How I prioritize*

```
[ Framework: RICE, Impact/Effort, etc. ]
```

### Step 6: MVP & Iteration
*How I scope MVP and plan iterations*

```
[ MVP definition, iteration plan, success criteria ]
```

## Practice Questions

- [ ] "Design a feature for [company] to improve [metric]"
- [ ] "How would you improve [existing product]?"
- [ ] "Pick top 3 features from this list and explain why"
- [ ] "Should we keep or kill [feature]?"

## Key Phrases & Terminology

| Term | When to Use |
|------|-------------|
| "Jobs to be done" | When identifying user needs |
| "Segment A vs B" | When showing user understanding |
| "MVP scope" | When discussing prioritization |
| "Iteration plan" | When showing long-term thinking |

---

## Prioritization Frameworks

### RICE
- **R**each: How many users?
- **I**mpact: How much value per user?
- **C**onfidence: How sure are we?
- **E**ffort: How much work?

### Impact/Effort Matrix
```
        Low Effort   High Effort
High    Quick Wins   Big Bets
Impact  ───────────────────────
Low     Fill-ins     Avoid
Impact
```

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

❌ Jumping to solutions without user understanding  
❌ No user segmentation  
❌ Missing prioritization framework  
❌ Ignoring constraints/tradeoffs
