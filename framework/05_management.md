# Management & Org Design Framework

> **Goal**: Demonstrate ability to build, scale, and manage operational excellence
>
> | Dimension | Description |
> |-----------|-------------|
> | **Signals** | Hiring bar, team topology, throughput, performance management, resource planning, staffing models |
> | **Weak Answer** | Generic ("I hire A-players"), no structural thinking, avoids hard people decisions |
> | **Strong Answer** | Explains team topology with rationale, describes specific hiring/calibration rigor, manages underperformance decisively, optimizes for throughput |
> | **IC5/IC6** | "I worked closely with Eng and Design to ship the feature" |
> | **IC7/D1** | "I re-org'd from feature-based to platform + stream-aligned pods, cutting coordination overhead 30%. Shifted staffing model to 70% execution / 30% innovation. Handled 2 PIP cases with documented rigor." |

## Core Signals to Show

- [ ] Hiring bar & calibration
- [ ] Org structure thinking (Topology)
- [ ] Throughput & efficiency metrics
- [ ] Performance management (PIPs, top talent)
- [ ] Resource planning & allocation

## Common Question Types

| Question | Key Elements to Address |
|----------|------------------------|
| "How would you re-org?" | Topology, rationale, change management, coordination overhead |
| "How do you hire?" | Bar calibration, scorecard design, network effect |
| "Manage an underperformer" | Direct feedback, documentation, PIP process, outcome |
| "Resource allocation" | Opportunity cost, strategic alignment, staffing models |
| "How do you scale X?" | Process automation, delegation, skill-gap analysis |

## My Framework/Approach

### Step 1: Org Design & Topology
*How I structure teams for maximum velocity*

```
[ Define your approach here ]
- Minimizing coordination overhead
- Aligning teams to user outcomes (Stream-aligned)
- Defining platform vs features
```

### Step 2: Hiring & Talent Density
*How I maintain a high bar at scale*

```
[ Your hiring approach ]
- Multi-dimensional scorecards
- Calibration rituals
- Onboarding for speed-to-impact
```

### Step 3: Performance Management
*How I handle the extremes (Top 5% and Bottom 5%)*

```
[ Your approach to performance ]
- Continuous feedback loops
- High-bar calibration
- Managing PIPs with empathy and rigor
```

### Step 4: Resource Planning
*How I decide where to put the next N people*

```
[ Your allocation framework ]
- Core vs. Growth vs. Exploratory
- Addressing tech debt vs. features
- ROE (Return on Engineering)
```

## Team Topology Models

### By Stream (Outcome-Aligned)
```
Stream-Aligned Team (owns user journey)
├── Discovery Team
├── Activation Team
├── Engagement Team
└── Monetization Team
```

### Platform + Stream
```
Organization
├── Platform Teams (shared infra, tools)
└── Stream-Aligned Teams (user outcomes)
```

## Hiring Scorecard Template

| Attribute | Weight | Weak (1-2) | Strong (4-5) |
|-----------|--------|------------|--------------|
| **Technical Intuition** | 25% | Superficial | Deep tradeoff fluency |
| **Operational Rigor** | 25% | Process-blind | Measured by outcomes |
| **Talent Magnet** | 20% | Hires friends | Great people follow them |
| **Strategic Context** | 20% | Task-focused | Connects work to biz goal |
| **Cultural Add** | 10% | Filter for same | Diversifies perspectives |

---

## Performance Management Playbook

| Scenario | Management Action |
|----------|-------------------|
| **High Performer** | Remove blockers, give more scope, advocate for promo |
| **Steady Performer** | Consistent feedback, skill development, maintain energy |
| **Underperformer** | Weekly 1:1, clear goals, PIP if no progress in 4 weeks |
| **Toxic Diva** | Direct feedback on behavior, zero tolerance for knavery |

## Key Phrases & Terminology

| Term | When to Use |
|------|-------------|
| "Coordination overhead" | Why a big team is slow |
| "Staffing model" | When discussing resource planning |
| "Throughput metrics" | When discussing efficiency |
| "Calibration" | When discussing hiring/performance consistency |

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

❌ Generic ("I hire A-players")  
❌ No structural thinking (re-orging based on people, not goals)  
❌ Avoiding difficult performance conversations  
❌ Treating all headcount as equal
