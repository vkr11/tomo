# Leadership & Drive Framework

> **Goal**: Demonstrate self-awareness, resilience, and influence without authority

> | **Weak Answer** | Blames external factors, no learning, vague outcomes, "we" when it was "I", no influence tactics |
> | **Strong Answer** | Owns failure completely, quantifies impact, explains influence strategy (coalition-building, reframing), demonstrates grit through specific actions |
> | **IC5/IC6** | "The project was delayed due to Eng resourcing issues" |
> | **IC7/D1** | "I underestimated integration complexity. We were 6 weeks late. I took ownership, influenced the VP of Eng to prioritize our API by reframing it as defensive moat against [competitor]. Worked 80hr weeks to stabilize. Now mandate tech spikes for all projects." |
