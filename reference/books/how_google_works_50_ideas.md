## Introduction
In 2010, we decided to write a book about the changing rules of management in the 21st century, based on the humbling and exhilarating experience of helping to build Google over the previous 10 years. In September 2014, we published *How Google Works*.

As we were working on the project, we collected all of our stories, principles, and sayings. When you strip away our stories and words, what you have left is our ideas—50 of them. This is what *How Google Works* is about.

## Part 1: What’s Different Now?

### (1) Three Converging Technology Platforms
**Internet, mobile, and cloud are transforming virtually every business sector.**
The Internet provides all the world’s information and media to a global audience for free. Mobile devices make global reach and continuous connectivity available to everyone. Cloud computing puts practically infinite computing power and machine learning at everyone’s disposal. As a result, resources that were previously scarce (information, data, connectivity, computing) are now abundant and cheap.

### (2) Unprecedented Speed of Transformation
**Transformation is happening at an unprecedented speed, and it is accelerating.**
Historically, general-purpose technologies (steam engine, electricity) took decades to achieve massive impact. Today, the worldwide web and smartphones reach global upheaval within a decade, driven by the exponential growth principles of Moore’s Law.

### (3) Democratization of Innovation
**The tools of innovation have been democratized.**
Open source software, APIs, and large datasets allow engineers to build on each other's work. Individuals and masses can build new inventions for free or very reasonable prices, solving "big, old problems" in clever new ways that were recently impossible.

### (4) Power Shift to the Customer
**The balance of power has shifted from companies to customers.**
Consumers have never been better informed. They can compare prices, reviews, and specs instantly on their phones. The only way for businesses to achieve success is to consistently create superior products, services, and experiences. Marketing and distribution control can no longer save bad products.

### (5) Impact of Small Teams
**Individuals and small teams can have a huge impact.**
Technology puts infinite data and computing power in every employee's hands. Small teams can create products that reach the world instantly. Rapid prototyping has dropped the cost of experimentation (and failure) dramatically.

### (6) Value of Product People
**Product people are more valuable than business people.**
The most valuable employees combine technical knowledge (engineers), business expertise (executives), and creativity. We call these people **"Smart Creatives."** Armed with data and analytical tools, they have everything they need to design, build, and improve products rapidly.

### (7) Designed for Speed, Not Risk
**Most companies today are designed to minimize risk, not maximize speed.**
Traditional management funnels information to a few executive decision-makers, which slows things down. In a time when speed is vital, most companies are still segregating skill sets (engineers vs. creatives) and checking every move, which is the opposite of what's needed for healthy product development.

## Part 2: Culture

### (8) Attract and Empower Smart Creatives
**The only way to consistently succeed is to attract the best smart creatives and create an environment where they can thrive at scale.**
Business leaders must cede a high degree of control. Management’s job is to stay out of the way and limit the total *cost* of errors, not the *number* of errors. Prevent the $10M mistake, not the $100K mistake.

### (9) Define Culture Early
**Once culture is set, selection bias sets in and it becomes very difficult to change.**
Actively plan the company’s culture at the outset. Live that culture—lead by example, not phrases—and communicate it authentically.

### (10) Build Around Small Teams
**Small teams can get more done than big ones.**
People on small teams are closely aligned, spend less time politicking, and social norms inspire higher performance. There’s "nowhere to hide."

### (11) Keep Them Crowded
**Offices should maximize energy and interactions, not peace and quiet.**
When you can reach out and tap someone on the shoulder, there is nothing to get in the way of communication and the flow of ideas.

### (12) Work from the Office
**Working from home kills innovation.**
Make sure your offices have everything employees need to be happy and productive, and then expect them to work there.

### (13) Listen to Ideas, Not the Hippo
**A Hippo is the "Highest Paid Person’s Opinion."**
Pay level is irrelevant to the winning argument. Create a meritocracy where the smartest arguments carry the day. Use the **"Rule of 7"** (managers should have at least 7 direct reports) to prevent micromanagement.

### (14) Organize Around High-Impact People
**There is no perfect organizational design.**
Put aside preconceived notions and determine which people are having the biggest impact (based on performance and passion). The most passionate people do things because they think it's right, not because they are told.

### (15) Re-org in a Day
**Do all re-orgs as quickly as possible.**
Solve the most important issues and communicate the principles, then let the team figure out the details. Don't try to achieve perfection.

### (16) Exile Knaves, Fight for Divas
**Knaves exhibit low integrity; always be firm with them. Divas exhibit high exceptionalism.**
As long as a diva's contributions match or exceed their ego, accommodate them. Great people are often difficult, but they produce great things.

### (17) Overwork in a Good Way
**Identify high-impact people and give them more to do.**
Grant them the freedom to manage their own lives. The right balance for the best people is often "ridiculously over-laden on both sides."

### (18) Cultivate Fun
**Humor is a healthy way for organizations to surface and discuss dissent.**
Structured "corporate fun" usually isn't fun. Give smart creatives freedom, and they will create fun organically. Open dissent through satire is often better than other modes.

## Part 3: Strategy

### (19) Strategic Principles over MBA-style Plans
**Business plans are bound to be obsolete within weeks.**
Give employees a solid foundation but the freedom to build on it without being constricted by a rigid plan. This is the freedom smart creatives crave.

### (20) Superior Products Start with Technical Insights
**Great products start by applying a technology or design insight that significantly shifts the cost-performance curve.**
Market research doesn't produce great technical insights. The "lab coats" are more important than the "suits."

### (21) Optimize for Growth
**Understand how to create and grow platforms.**
Competitive advantages are fleeting, so you need a "grow big, fast" strategy. A powerful way to do this is to **default to open.**

### (22) Know Your Competition, Don't Copy Them
**Copying leading competitors only leads to incremental improvement.**
While you fight over share points, someone else will create a new platform for the entire industry.

### (23) Ask the Hardest Questions
**Challenge your industry and company positioning by asking the hardest questions.**
Use that challenge to assemble a few smart creatives to develop a new path based on technical insights and open platforms.

## Part 4: Talent

### (24) Hiring is the Most Important Thing You Do
**Hiring defines a company and creates a network effect.**
Great people attract more great people. It is often easier to change hiring practices than to change an existing culture from within.

### (25) Interviewing is a Key Skill
**Interviewing is remarkably difficult to do well.**
Practice it often, regardless of your level. Recognize and reward your most prolific interviewers.

### (26) Hire Learning Animals, Not Specialists
**The ability to learn new things is more important than specific experience.**
In dynamic industries, learners will adapt to new roles while role specialists will not. (Deep scientific expertise is the only exception).

### (27) Check Biases at the Door
**Homogeneity breeds failure.**
Bring in a wide variety of viewpoints and backgrounds. Great talent often doesn't look or act like you.

### (28) Decisions by Committee, Not Individual Managers
**Hiring and promotion decisions are too important to entrust to one person.**
Use committees represented by different levels. Decisions should be based on a comprehensive data packet, removing politicking and friends-hiring-friends.

### (29) Reward Top Performers Disproportionately
**Smart creatives have inordinate impact.**
Reward the great ones with significantly more compensation and responsibility.

### (30) Force Rotation
**The best people are usually the ones to get bored.**
Silos are death to innovation. Create rotation programs to keep talent challenged and energize the company with a steady stream of moving talent.

## Part 5: Decision-Making

### (31) Consensus is about the Best Idea, Not Agreement
**Consensus requires dissent and for everyone's voice to be heard.**
People need to debate points in an open environment to have full buy-in on the ultimate decision. Smart creatives need to be heard, even if they don't carry the day.

### (32) Make All Decisions with Data
**"Let me show you" is better than "I think."**
Presentations should contain the raw data so that everyone in the meeting starts with the same facts.

### (33) Meet Every Day
**Leaders can't dictate decisions, but they can control the calendar.**
For the most important decisions, meeting daily signals priority and eliminates the need to re-hash old material.

### (34) Acknowledge that Both Sides are Right
**To gain true consensus, you must touch people's hearts.**
Acknowledge that dissenters' opinions and data were valid. It's rare for smart people to be completely wrong.

### (35) Every Meeting Needs an Owner
**Meetings should have a single decision-maker who drives the process.**
The owner (preferably the most senior person) sets the agenda and produces minutes quickly. Meetings should be small and easy to kill.

### (36) Everyone Needs a Coach
**The world’s best athletes have coaches, and business people should too.**
Coaches make individual executives better and improve the performance of entire teams.

## Part 6: Communication

### (37) Default to Open
**The job of leaders is to maximize the velocity and volume of information flow.**
Aggressively promote transparency. Hoarding information into silos is the natural tendency as companies grow; leaders must actively fight it.

### (38) Be an Effective Router
**A leader’s job is to route information quickly, not hoard it.**
Stay on top of your inbox and be thoughtful about who should see what. Don't waste people's time with pointless distribution lists.

### (39) Start Conversations
**Conversations are the richest form of communication.**
Don't limit chats to work-related topics. Create opportunities for genuine, unstructured interaction.

### (40) Repetition Doesn't Spoil the Prayer
**Over-communicate your core values and messages.**
Smart creatives require "why" (context) as well as "what" (prescriptions). Authenticity is key; people spot insincere "corporate" messaging easily.

### (41) Relationships over Process
**In a successful business, chaos is the normal state.**
When business outruns process, you depend on relationships to get things done. Insights often come from these informal networks rather than formal processes.

## Part 7: Innovation

### (42) CEO as Chief Innovation Officer
**Innovation can't be managed via committees.**
Innovative people don't need to be told to be innovative; they need to be allowed to do it. Only the CEO has the power to protect that culture.

### (43) Think 10X, Not 10%
**Thinking big gives people freedom to remove constraints.**
Aiming for 10x improvements spurs ideas that 10% increments would never consider. It also attracts the most ambitious talent.

### (44) Focus on the User
**Create radically better products, and the money will follow.**
Product teams should focus on being "surprisingly better." A smart company will find a way to monetize high-value, differentiated products.

### (45) Empower Smart Creatives over Managers
**Ideas can come from anywhere.**
Policies like **"20% Time"** are about the freedom to work on your own ideas. It allows employees to use company resources to develop new concepts without a manager saying no.

### (46) Set Unattainable Goals
**Audacious goals push people beyond small thinking.**
Achieving 70% of a massive goal is better than 100% of a safe one. Explain *why* goals weren't met and how to adjust.

### (47) Optimize for Speed
**Ship and iterate quickly based on market data.**
Tolerate some messiness. When things fail, fail quickly and salvage the technology/expertise.

### (48) Fail Well
**Failure is permissible if the team was thinking big and focusing on the user.**
Be ruthless with "sunk costs," learn from the failure, and don't stigmatize the people involved.

### (49) Imagine the Unimaginable
**Ask what could be true in five years that is currently "unimaginable."**
Challenge conventional wisdom to see what might actually be possible.

### (50) Technology Optimism
**Most big problems are information problems.**
With enough data and processing power, virtually any challenge facing humanity can be solved. Computers exist to serve people and make lives better.

## Part 8: The AI Era (2024+ Update)
*Strategic shifts for the Google of today*

### (51) Be "AI First" in Everything
**AI is not just a feature; it is the platform shift.**
Every product must be reimagined with AI at the core, not bolted on as an afterthought.

### (52) Scrappy Speed (The "Code Red" Mentality)
**Shed big-company lethargy to stay competitive.**
In a platform shift, velocity matters more than perfection. Re-adopt the mentality of a 0→1 startup.

### (53) Data is the New Moat
**Proprietary data and user feedback loops are the enduring advantages.**
As models become commoditized, your ability to train on unique internal datasets becomes your primary defense.

### (54) UI as a Conversation
**Search is evolving from "ten blue links" to a conversational journey.**
The "Assistant" is the product. The interface should focus on helping the user complete a task rather than just finding a link.

### (55) Full-Stack Integration Wins
**Vertical integration from silicon to application creates an uncatchable lead.**
Owning the **TPUs** (silicon), **Gemini** (model), and **Search/Workspace** (application) creates efficiencies competitors cannot match.

### (56) Bold but Responsible
**Trust is the most valuable currency in the AI era.**
We must be bold in technical innovation but cautious in deployment. Safeguards for safety, privacy, and security are fundamental.

### (57) The AI-Enhanced Creative
**The "Smart Creative" now uses AI to amplify output 10x.**
Prompt engineering, AI collaboration, and leveraging LLMs for coding and synthesis are now core requirements for being a top performer.
