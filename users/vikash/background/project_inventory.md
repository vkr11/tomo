## Stories Already Captured (from 2022 notes)

### Story 1: Critical Feedback — "Ask for Help Sooner" (Growth/Friend Graph)

| Element | Details |
|---------|---------|
| **Context** | Real World Friend Graph project, 38-person XFN team |
| **Situation** | Needed to hire 2 PMs, hiring took longer, stretched thin managing entire team |
| **Feedback** | Manager said I should have asked for help earlier |
| **Root Cause** | Tried to deliver with limited PM support, dropped balls or delivered lower quality |
| **Learning** | (1) Ask for help sooner, (2) Define priority and communicate quickly to team/leadership |
| **What I Do Now** | Define prioritized work and get alignment; create processes to scale (agendas, operating models); ultimately hired 2 PMs and stabilized team |
| **Impact** | >1% MAU for FB & IG, 5% of all Messenger conversations |

### Story 2: Big Ambiguous Problem — PETs (Privacy Ads)

| Element | Details |
|---------|---------|
| **Context** | iOS 14 + Google cookie deprecation created signal loss in ads |
| **Situation** | Needed fundamental shift in how ads are delivered; required new tech, new ad model, industry acceptance |
| **Why Ambiguous** | Required alignment from mobileOS vendors, browser vendors, regulators, competitors, advertisers, users — we didn't control the strategy |
| **Challenges** | (1) Internal alignment on giving up control/differentiation, (2) Defining team structure (XFN-heavy vs eng-first), (3) Managing media perception, (4) PETs tech not understood by industry |
| **Actions** | (1) Defined maturity framework with exit criteria, (2) Drove W3C PATCG formation — got 3 of 4 big players + competitors, (3) Mozilla co-authored proposal (big win), (4) Educated via blogs, videos, PETS Summit, (5) Defined 2025 privacy-ads vision, drove cross-company alignment |
| **Failures** | (1) Failed to hire — candidates couldn't define impact, needed different skill, (2) Didn't get initial proposals out fast enough |
| **Learnings** | `TODO: Extract key learnings` |
