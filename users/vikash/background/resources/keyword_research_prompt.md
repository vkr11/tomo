```text
Act as a Principal Product Strategy Consultant conducting market intelligence for a high-level executive portfolio review.

I will provide a list of specific proprietary tech initiatives at Meta (Facebook/WhatsApp) and other companies. 
For EACH initiative, please:

1. **Identify the External "Why"**: Connect the project to specific major regulatory events (e.g., EU DMA, HUD Settlement), market shifts (e.g., iOS14 Signal Loss), or competitor moves (e.g., OpenAI releases) that happened around that time.
2. **Find Public Scale & Impact**: Estimate the revenue scale, user reach, or strategic value based on public earnings calls, engineering blogs, press releases (TechCrunch/TheVerge), or whitepapers.
3. **Extract Technical Keywords**: List the specific high-signal technical terms associated with this work (e.g., "MPC," "RLHF," "Variance Reduction System," "Click-to-WhatsApp").
4. **Draft a "Resume Power Bullet"**: Write one sentence that frames this internal work as a massive industry-shaping achievement.

Here are the initiatives to research:

### 1. WhatsApp Marketing Messages & Revenue Unlock
*   **Context**: Launching "Web Custom Audiences" (WCA) for WhatsApp Business to unblock revenue.
*   **Specifics**: Integration with Meta Ads Manager, "Click-to-WhatsApp" ads growth.
*   **Key Question**: What was the revenue growth trajectory of WhatsApp Business/Click-to-Messaging ads during 2023-2025? How critical was WCA for this?

### 2. Meta HEC Ads (Housing, Employment, Credit) & VRS
*   **Context**: Settlement with HUD/DOJ regarding algorithmic discrimination.
*   **Specifics**: "Variance Reduction System" (VRS), removal of "Special Ad Audiences."
*   **Key Question**: How did the DOJ settlement redefine algorithmic fairness standards for the entire ad-tech industry? What technical precedent did VRS set?

### 3. Llama Safety & Red Teaming (MSL)
*   **Context**: Llama 2/3/4 releases, "Purple Llama" initiative, Child Safety.
*   **Specifics**: NIST "Safety by Design" alignment, MLCommons hazard taxonomy, Llama Guard.
*   **Key Question**: How is Meta's "Purple Teaming" approach differentiated from competitors? What are the specific industry standards for CSAM prevention in open-weights models?

### 4. Ads Free Subscription (AFS) & EU Privacy
*   **Context**: "Pay or Consent" model in Europe response to DMA/GDPR.
*   **Specifics**: Launch of €9.99 subscription, recent pivot to "Less Personalized Ads."
*   **Key Question**: What are the financial stakes of the EU DMA non-compliance fines for Meta? Why is the "Less Personalized Ads" tier technically difficult?

### 5. Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PETs) & IPA
*   **Context**: Post-iOS14 signal loss strategy. Partnership with Mozilla.
*   **Specifics**: "Interoperable Private Attribution" (IPA), W3C PATCG group, MPC (Multi-Party Computation).
*   **Key Question**: Why was the Mozilla partnership surprising/significant? How does IPA technically solve attribution without cookies?

### 6. Real World Friend Graph & Scraping Risks
*   **Context**: Using phone/email contact uploads to foster growth (~2019 era) vs. security risks.
*   **Specifics**: TechCrunch reports on "phone number enumeration" (419M records exposed).
*   **Key Question**: What were the specific scale/security trade-offs discussed in the security community regarding "contact importers" during 2018-2020?
