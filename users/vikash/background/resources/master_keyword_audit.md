## 4. Live JD Verification Notes (Jan 18, 2026)
*   **OpenAI:** "Preparedness Framework" is key. No "Head of Product" roles open, mainly generic "Member of Technical Staff" or "Product Manager" (level fluid).
*   **Anthropic:** "Steerable," "Reliable," and "eveloper Workflows" are big. "Safety Radar" is a specific hiring theme.
*   **Google DeepMind:** "Research to Production" is the mantra. "Technical Intelligence" role focuses on infra/cloud economics (matches your ASIC bg).
*   **Scale AI:** "Trust & Safety" and "RLHF" are central.
